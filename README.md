# YouTube Transcript Infographic Generator ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“Š

## Vision
To help creators, marketers, and educators transform any block of textâ€”such as a video transcript, article, or notesâ€”into an instantly shareable, visually appealing vertical infographic.

## Why Was This Made?
Manually designing infographics is a slow and tedious process. It requires design skills, time, and effort to distill key information and present it effectively. This tool automates the entire workflow, from content analysis to final visual design, allowing anyone to create professional-grade infographics in seconds.
